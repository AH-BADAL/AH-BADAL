My goal is to become a full-stack web developer who not only writes code but also creates impact.For me, LinkedIn is more than a profile—it's a platform where I connect, share, and grow with like-minded individuals in the tech community. I'm always open to learning opportunities, collaborations, and meaningful conversations.Skills & Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (if applicable), Git & GitHub, problem solving Learning mindset |Innovation-driven | Future developer
